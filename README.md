## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Dilesh Bisen, currently  pursuing a B.Tech in third year CSE at IIIT Pune. I have a strong foundation in programming , and I enjoy working on full-stack development projects using technologies like React, Next.js, MERN stack and Django. Iâ€™ve built several projects, including a financial management application which helped me develop problem-solving skills and a keen eye for user experience. Outside of coding, I love tackling competitive programming challenges on platforms like LeetCode and CodeChef, where Iâ€™ve achieved decent rankings. Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. Looking forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team!

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative tech projects.
